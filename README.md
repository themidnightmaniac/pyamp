### What it can do:
<ul>
<li>Pause, Play, Skip, Rewind and Stop songs.</li>
<li>Display album cover art.</li>
<li>Add songs, as well as clearing the queue.</li>
<li>Display the song currently playing.</li>
<li>Display the song progress using a bar and the actual time elapsed/left.
<li>Change MPD's volume using a slider.</li>
<li>Display the time (clock)</li>
<li>Execute any command on song change</li>
</ul>

### What it can't do (yet):
<ul>
<li>Display the queue.</li>
<li>Interact with playlists.</li>
<li>Remove single songs.</li>
</ul>

### What it will not do:
<ul>
<li>Fetch lyrics from the internet.</li>
<li>Get you a girlfriend.</li>
</ul>
This is my first ever project in any programming language, so the code is very messy and unoptimized. If you want to contribute, fork or even remake Pyamp you are welcome.<br>
Also if you find any bug or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue and i'll be happy to help.<br>
