### What it can do:
- **Pause**, **Play**, **Skip**, **Rewind**, and **Stop** songs.
- Display **album cover art**.
- Add songs and **clear the queue**.
- Display the **currently playing song**.
- Show **song progress** with a progress bar and display the actual time elapsed/left.
- Control MPD's **volume** using a slider.
- Display the **current time (clock)**.
- Execute any command on **song change**.

### What it can't do (yet):
- Cannot display the queue.
- Cannot interact with **playlists**.
- Cannot **remove individual songs**.

### What Pyamp will **not** do:
- **Fetch lyrics** from the internet.
- **Find you a girlfriend**.  

This is my first ever project in any programming language, so the code is quite messy and unoptimized. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork and open a pr. Contributions are always welcome.  
If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue, and I'll be happy to help!
